# First Lunar Credit Union (FLCU)
**Provable, Private, and Pledgeable Payroll**

## Description
Privacy-focused payroll platform for stablecoin payments built on Aztec L2. Enables private employee compensation, yield-earning treasuries, and income-based credit access.

## Motivation
Stablecoin earners face three critical problems:
- **Privacy:** Transparent blockchains expose everyone's salary
- **Productivity:** Payroll treasuries sit idle instead of earning yield
- **Credit:** No way to prove income for loans without bank verification

## Problems
1. **No Privacy for Crypto Employees** - Salaries are public on transparent chains, forcing awkward wallet rotation
2. **Dead Capital in Payroll** - Business treasuries earn nothing while waiting for payday
3. **No Credit Access** - Stablecoin earners can't prove income to access loans

## Solutions
1. **Private Payroll on Aztec L2**
   - Employees get confidential vault accounts
   - Businesses pay via Ethereum → Human Bridge → Aztec private vaults
   - Salary amounts stay completely private

2. **Yield on Payroll Treasuries**
   - Businesses earn yield on funds until exact moment of distribution
   - Works on both Ethereum and Aztec
   - Transforms payroll from cost to productive asset

3. **"First Dibs" Income Pledge**
   - Employees pledge future salary for credit access now
   - Any lender can offer credit, not just banks
   - Smart contracts auto-enforce when payroll runs

## Impact
- Private payroll for all Ethereum stablecoin earners
- Businesses earn yield until payday
- Stablecoin workers can access credit by pledging future income
- New DeFi primitive for income-based lending

## Future Extensions
- Stronger first dibs mechanism as platform adoption grows
- Business revenue pledges (not just employee payroll)
- Cross-chain privacy for all stablecoin ecosystems
